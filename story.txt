A sparrow is at ease resting on a big tree. A rabbit passed by, admiring the 
sparrow's life, and asked, "friend, what can I do with sitting like you?" The 
sparrow replied lazily, "no problem, what's wrong with that?" So, the rabbit 
has a kind of learning style, sitting on the ground to rest, looks very 
comfortable. Suddenly, a wolf appeared, grabbed the rabbit and ate it up.
Revelation: to sit and do nothing, you have to sit high.

The sparrow heard a sound below him, so he looked down. There was no sign of
the rabbit. The sparrow assumed that the rabbit just left, so he just went 
back to resting on his branch.

The sparrow continued to rest on the branch, despite the tragedy of the rabbit.
Suddenly, a strong gust of wind came along and pushed the sparrow of the tree. As the
sparrow fell, it thought to itself, "Why should I be concerned? I am high up.". The sparrow
hit the ground head first and died from the impact.
Revelation: The higher you are the harder you fall.

The wolf reappeared to feast on the fallen sparrow. While snacking on yet another easy 
meal, a poacher watched through his scope. The wolf was an impossible to miss target as
he sat under the tree chewing the sparrow. The last thing through the wolf's head was not
a thought, but a bullet.
Revelation: preying on the lazy in effect makes one lazy
Hope this story brings you something in your mind, have a good day!
