A sparrow is at ease resting on a big tree. A rabbit passed by, admiring the 
sparrow's life, and asked, "friend, what can I do with sitting like you?" The 
sparrow replied lazily, "no problem, what's wrong with that?" So, the rabbit 
has a kind of learning style, sitting on the ground to rest, looks very 
comfortable. Suddenly, a wolf appeared, grabbed the rabbit and ate it up.
Revelation: to sit and do nothing, you have to sit high.
